# Energy-Efficiency-Prediction-Regression
**The purpose of this project is to estimate Heating Load (HL) and Cooling Load (CL), we can compare a traditional linear regression approach to a sophisticated nonlinear non-parametric method like Random Forest**
# Project Overview:
**Exploratory Analysis is done to understand how the HL and CL, vary by different Input Features like Surface Area, Relative Compactness, Overall Height etc and dropping irrelevant features**
**Mean Squared Error and R^2 score of 5 different Machine Learning Regression models is calculated and the results are summarized**
