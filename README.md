# Energy-Efficiency-Prediction-Regression
**The purpose of this project is to estimate Heating Load (HL) and Cooling Load (CL), we can compare a traditional linear regression approach to a sophisticated nonlinear non-parametric method like Random Forest**
# Project Overview:
**Exploratory Analysis is done to understand how the HL and CL, vary by different Input Features like Surface Area, Relative Compactness, Overall Height etc and dropping irrelevant features**

**Mean Squared Error and R^2 score of 5 different Machine Learning Regression models for the two outputs (HL and CL), is calculated and the results are summarized**

**Best Regression Model for Heating Load: DecisionTree Regressor with R^2 = 0.997 and Mean Squared Error = 0.3**

**Best Regression Model for Cooling Load: DecisionTree Regressor with R^2 = 0.959 and Mean Squared Error = 3.7**
